# 🦋 Qe Light Engine (QeLE)

> **Lightweight, GPU-free image representation and reconstruction engine for low-resource devices.**

**QeLE** is a novel system that encodes images as structured text or compact binary data using the **Quadrante Espacial (Qe)** format — enabling lossless reconstruction, efficient storage, and scalable processing on CPUs only.

## 💡 Vision

Enable AI-powered image generation and editing on **Raspberry Pi, old laptops, and edge devices** — while reducing the environmental and economic impact of AI.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **No GPU required** – runs on CPU only
- ✅ **Lossless reconstruction** – SSIM = 1.0
- ✅ **Textual or binary format** – human-readable or compact
- ✅ **Scalable** – works on pixel art, photos, and future video frames
- ✅ **Extensible** – supports color palettes, compression, and editing

## 🛠️ Quick Start (Google Colab)

```python
!pip install qele  # future PyPI package
# Or clone and run examples/demo_colab.ipynb
